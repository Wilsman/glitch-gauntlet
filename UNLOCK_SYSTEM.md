---

## üîì Unlock System Architecture

### Progression Storage (`src/lib/progressionStorage.ts`)

**Storage Method:** localStorage (persists across sessions)

**Storage Key:** `glitch-gauntlet-progression`

**Data Structure:**
```typescript
interface PlayerProgression {
  timesReachedLevel10: number;      // Count of level 10 achievements
  unlockedCharacters: CharacterType[]; // Array of unlocked character types
  highestWaveReached: number;        // Best wave performance
  totalGamesPlayed: number;          // Total games started
  totalEnemiesKilled: number;        // Lifetime enemy kills
  lastUpdated: number;               // Timestamp
}
```

**Default Unlocked Characters:**
- Spray 'n' Pray
- Boom Bringer
- Glass Cannon Carl

### Unlock Criteria Types

```typescript
type UnlockCriteriaType = 'level10Count' | 'waveReached' | 'gamesPlayed';

interface UnlockCriteria {
  type: UnlockCriteriaType;
  required: number;
  description: string;
}
```

**Current Criteria:**
- `level10Count`: Track how many times player reached level 10
- `waveReached`: Track highest wave reached (for future unlocks)
- `gamesPlayed`: Track total games played (for future unlocks)

---

## üéØ How It Works

### 1. Level 10 Tracking

When a player reaches level 10 in a game:

1. `LocalGameEngine` detects level up to 10
2. Checks if this player already counted this game (prevents multiple counts)
3. Calls `incrementLevel10Count()` to update localStorage
4. Calls `checkUnlocks()` to see if any characters should unlock
5. If character unlocks, triggers callback to show notification

**Code Location:** `src/lib/LocalGameEngine.ts` ‚Üí `updateXPOrbs()`

```typescript
if (p.level === 10 && !this.level10Tracked.has(p.id)) {
  this.level10Tracked.add(p.id);
  incrementLevel10Count();
  
  const newlyUnlocked = checkUnlocks();
  if (newlyUnlocked.length > 0 && this.onUnlock) {
    newlyUnlocked.forEach(charType => this.onUnlock!(charType));
  }
}
```

### 2. Character Selection UI

**Carousel Layout:**
- Shows 1.5 characters at a time (current + partial next)
- Navigation arrows (left/right)
- Dot indicators for position
- Smooth scroll animations

**Locked Character Display:**
- Grayscale filter
- Reduced opacity (0.6)
- Lock icon üîí overlay
- "LOCKED" badge
- Stats visible but grayed out

**Hover Tooltip:**
- Follows mouse cursor
- Shows unlock criteria
- Shows progress (e.g., "2/3 times reached level 10")
- Only appears on locked characters

### 3. Unlock Notification

When a character unlocks:

1. Full-screen celebration overlay
2. "CHARACTER UNLOCKED!" message
3. Character card with emoji and details
4. Animated entrance (scale + rotate)
5. Toast notification in-game
6. Auto-dismisses after 4 seconds

**Components:**
- `UnlockNotification.tsx` - Full-screen celebration
- Toast notification - In-game alert

// Load progression from localStorage
getProgression(): PlayerProgression

// Save progression to localStorage
saveProgression(progression: PlayerProgression): void

// Update specific fields
updateProgression(updates: Partial<PlayerProgression>): PlayerProgression

// Increment level 10 counter
incrementLevel10Count(): PlayerProgression

// Check if character is unlocked
isCharacterUnlocked(characterType: CharacterType): boolean

---

## üöÄ Future Extensibility

### Adding New Unlock Criteria

1. Add new type to `UnlockCriteriaType` in `types.ts`
2. Track new stat in `PlayerProgression` interface
3. Add tracking logic in appropriate location
4. Add check in `checkUnlocks()` function

**Example: Wave-based unlock**

```typescript
// In types.ts
type UnlockCriteriaType = 'level10Count' | 'waveReached' | 'gamesPlayed';

// In characterConfig.ts
unlockCriteria: {
  type: 'waveReached',
  required: 10,
  description: 'Reach wave 10 in any game',
}

// In progressionStorage.ts checkUnlocks()
if (
  progression.highestWaveReached >= 10 &&
  !progression.unlockedCharacters.includes('new-character')
) {
  unlockCharacter('new-character');
  newlyUnlocked.push('new-character');
}
```

### Adding New Characters

1. Add character type to `CharacterType` union
2. Define character in `CHARACTERS` object
3. Set `locked: true` and define `unlockCriteria`
4. Add emoji to GameCanvas character mapping
5. Add unlock check logic if using new criteria type

## üêõ Testing

### Manual Testing

**Test Unlock Progression:**
```typescript
// In browser console
import { incrementLevel10Count, getProgression } from './progressionStorage';

// Manually increment
incrementLevel10Count();
incrementLevel10Count();
incrementLevel10Count();

// Check progression
console.log(getProgression());
```

**Reset Progression:**
```typescript
import { resetProgression } from './progressionStorage';
resetProgression();
```

**Force Unlock:**
```typescript
import { unlockCharacter } from './progressionStorage';
unlockCharacter('pet-pal-percy');
```

### Test Scenarios

1. ‚úÖ Level 10 only counts once per game
2. ‚úÖ Progress persists across page refreshes
3. ‚úÖ Locked character shows tooltip on hover
4. ‚úÖ Unlock notification appears when criteria met
5. ‚úÖ Unlocked character becomes selectable
6. ‚úÖ Pet Pal Percy starts with pet companion
7. ‚úÖ Carousel navigation works smoothly
8. ‚úÖ Partial visibility of locked character invites exploration

## üìä Analytics Opportunities

Future tracking possibilities:
- Which characters are most popular?
- How long does it take to unlock Pet Pal Percy?
- Do players try new characters after unlocking?
- Unlock rate vs player retention

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

1. **LocalStorage Only:** Progress lost if localStorage cleared
2. **Single Player:** No cloud sync across devices
3. **No Backup:** Can't recover lost progress
4. **Cheat Vulnerable:** Players can edit localStorage (acceptable for single-player)

---

## üéØ Success Metrics

- **Curiosity:** Partial visibility of locked character
- **Progression:** Clear progress tracking (X/3)
- **Reward:** Satisfying unlock celebration
- **Retention:** Reason to keep playing
- **Variety:** New playstyle to try

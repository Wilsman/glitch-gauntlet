# Input Lag & Performance Optimizations

## Changes Made

### 1. **Increased Game Loop Frequency** (`useGameLoop.ts`)
- **Before**: 50ms interval (20 updates/sec)
- **After**: 33ms interval (~30 updates/sec)
- **Impact**: Reduces max input delay from 50ms to 33ms (34% improvement)

### 2. **Keyboard Input Optimization** (`useGameLoop.ts`)
- Added `preventDefault` to all keyboard handlers
- Prevents browser default behavior that can add lag
- Ensures immediate input capture without browser interference

### 3. **Canvas Rendering Optimization** (`GameCanvas.tsx`)
- **Disabled event listening**: Added `listening={false}` to Konva Stage
  - Prevents unnecessary event processing overhead
  - Canvas is display-only, doesn't need mouse/touch events
- **Memoized background grid**: Static grid now renders once and reuses
  - Eliminates ~64 rectangle recalculations per frame
  - Significant CPU savings on every render

### 4. **CSS Performance** (`index.css`)
- Added `will-change: opacity` to animated overlay
- Added `will-change: auto` to static scanline effect
- Hints to browser for GPU acceleration of effects

## Expected Results

### Input Responsiveness
- **~17ms faster** input response (50ms â†’ 33ms loop)
- **Instant key capture** with preventDefault
- **Smoother movement** with higher update rate

### Rendering Performance
- **Reduced CPU usage** from memoized grid
- **Better frame pacing** from optimized canvas
- **GPU-accelerated effects** from will-change hints

## Additional Recommendations (Not Implemented)

If you need even more responsiveness:

1. **Client-side prediction**: Immediately update local player position on input, then reconcile with server
2. **WebSocket connection**: Replace polling with real-time bidirectional communication
3. **Reduce network payload**: Only send deltas instead of full game state
4. **requestAnimationFrame**: Decouple rendering from game loop for 60fps display
5. **Web Workers**: Move game logic processing off main thread

## Testing

Test the changes by:
1. Press and hold movement keys - should feel more immediate
2. Rapid direction changes - should be more responsive
3. Monitor browser DevTools Performance tab for reduced CPU usage
4. Check Network tab - should see requests every ~33ms instead of 50ms

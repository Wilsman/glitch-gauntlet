## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Status Effects System

Enemies can have multiple status effects simultaneously:

```typescript
interface StatusEffect {
  type: 'burning' | 'poisoned' | 'frozen' | 'slowed';
  damage?: number; // DoT damage per tick
  duration: number; // remaining duration in ms
  slowAmount?: number; // movement speed multiplier (0-1)
}
```

### Explosion System

```typescript
interface Explosion {
  id: string;
  position: Vector2D;
  radius: number; // 80 units
  timestamp: number;
  damage: number; // Based on enemy max HP * explosionDamage multiplier
  ownerId: string;
}
```

### Pierce System

Projectiles track hit enemies to prevent double-hits:

```typescript
interface Projectile {
  hitEnemies?: string[]; // IDs of enemies already hit
  pierceRemaining?: number; // how many more enemies can be pierced
}
```

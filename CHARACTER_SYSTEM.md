export type WeaponType = 'rapid-fire' | 'grenade-launcher' | 'sniper-shot';
```

Located in `shared/characterConfig.ts`:
- Defines base stats for each character
- Exports helper functions to retrieve character data

### Weapon Behaviors

- Radius: 5
- Works with all upgrade modifiers

**Grenade Launcher (Boom Bringer):**

- Explosion damage affected by upgrade modifiers

**Sniper Shot (Glass Cannon Carl):**

- Same as rapid-fire but with higher base damage
- 3x crit multiplier instead of 2x

### Game Engine Integration

The `LocalGameEngine` constructor accepts a `CharacterType` parameter:

```typescript
constructor(playerId: string, characterType: CharacterType = 'spray-n-pray')
```

Character stats are applied during player initialization.
